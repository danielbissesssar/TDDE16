    "**RQ 1.1:** Why do we remove common stop words and lemmatise the text? Can you give an example of a scenario where, in addition to common stopwords, there are also *domain-specific* or *application-specific* stop words?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We remove stop words and lemmatise the text to make the sparse vector representation smaller and more targeted. Stop words are grammar specific and are widely used everywhere in text, thus they will inevitably be the most frequently used words (distributed according to zipfs law). However, they provide no topical meaning in the given context and will only be overshadowing the more relevant words, unnecessarily waste memory resources, and slow down search time. \n",
    "Simularly, there are many grammatical forms for a given word, but the meaning is always more or less the same. Thus, converting all possible variations of a word to its lemma representation will remove redundancy, make the term frequency based representation faster, and more accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Domain-specific* stop words are words that will often occur in a given context, but not provide any relevant meaning to the text. The dataset for this lab is the \"app description\" dataset, and one of the most common word is \"app\". This is a typical word in this context and do not provide any useful meaning to the description and can thus be considered a *Domain-specific* stop word. Another similar example would be the word \"movie\" or \"actor\" in a dataset based on movie descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**RQ 1.2:** In Problem&nbsp;2, what do the dimensions of the matrix `X` correspond to? This matrix gives rise to different types of *representations*. Explain what these representations are. What information from the data is preserved, what information is lost in these representations?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Every entry in the array represents a document, and every document is represented with a sparse vector containing tf_idf value for all terms from the trained vectorizer, in order. Meaning: if a term does not exist in the document, it will be represented by a zero, and if it does exist, it will be a weighted value based on the \"term frequency inverse document frequency\" value. It is meant to represent how important a word is to a document by combining the term frequency with the inverse document frequency which attempts to give more discriminative power to terms by penalizing generic words, and thus the information about frequency is partly lost due to this compensation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**RQ 1.3:** What does it mean that a term has a high/low idf value? Based on this, how can we use idf to automatically identify stop words? Why do you think is idf not used as a term weighting on its own, but always in connection with term frequency (tf–idf)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> A high idf value on a term means that it is very frequently used in the given dataset. This implies that it might not provide any unique and/or relevant meaning in the context. Usually it would indicate that the word is a stop word. It could be a standard grammatical stop word or a domain-specific stop word. As such, it is possible to automatically identify these stop words by looking at the terms with the highest idf values.\n",
    "However, sometimes terms with high idf values provides relevant meaning as well. For example: The dataset for this lab had \"game\" as the most common term (excluding the already removed grammatical stop words), but it is actually a relevant term which says that this app is a game. Not all apps are games, so it could be useful information in the given context.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Only using the idf value means that there is no distinguishing between a term that only occurs once in a document and a term that occurs many times in that document. If the document is a description of a train game, then the term 'train' will most likely occur many times, but this information will be lost and overshadowed with other terms with higher idf values, like for example, some commonly used adjectives. Since 'train' is something we would expect to find in that context, using the tf to enhance the idf values here is highly relevant."
